## Summary

many aspects their company specializes in including search engine optimization, online reputation management, and 
social media marketing.

## Deployed Link

## Work Involved
 For this site, I modified the css and html files by adding semantic structural elements, creating a logial structure and ensuring everything was in sequential order, adding alt attributes, making sure all of the links worked properly, and by adding a title. These changes allow the css and html to be more accessible, organized, and improved its functionality.
